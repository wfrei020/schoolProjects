The following are project given to me in school and were to teach me 
about different programming languages and programming concepts
including 

c++
c
python
scheme
GO
java
perl
R


Please use these programs as a reference to the way I develop code

since this repository is open for employers to see and students can also see,
I am not posting any of the questions that i was asked as i do not 
want other student to copy my assingments

All of the programs were developed by myself.

I also achieved between  95% to 100% in all the programs posted.
